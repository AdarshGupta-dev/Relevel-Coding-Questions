# Relevel Coding Questions

Hi Everyone.

Are you appearing for Backend, Frontend, Data Analytics, Full Stack or Software Testing test on Relevel?

<br>

Good. I am proud of you for taking a step to improve yourself.

<br>

For all these tests, Relevel has a total of 5 rounds.

<b>Round 1. Back To Basics</b>

Relevel has a total of 600 questions. Out of which 30, 40, or 60 questions (depending on the test you are appearing for) will be asked.

- Most of these are easy. If you are unsure, use google lens to find answers immediately. I plan to create a page listing all of these questions.

- If you are appearing for the test, feel free to send me the questions. I will put all questions with the right answers in one place. So, others may use it as a study guide.

<b>Round 2. DSA i.e. Coding Round</b>

Relevel has only 200 questions. Their questions are new and unique. Kudos.

- Each of their questions looks difficult. They look like you need Ph.D. in CSE and mathematics to solve them. But, they don't. They are designed to fool you.

1. The first thing you should do is reduce the story given to you into 3 lines of a problem statement.
2. Now, create 5-6 dummy sample inputs of your own and think of a solution.
3. Think of edge cases where your problem statement may clash with the story.
4. Now, surprisingly easiest part, coding the problem statement.

NOTE: Think of easy ways to solve. I promise you this, these question does not require any high level of DSA, only basics. Now, think of O(n) algorithm. Most of them can be solved in a linear time.

- If you have appeared in these tests, please send me the questions you faced. I will add them here, with proper answers and explanations.

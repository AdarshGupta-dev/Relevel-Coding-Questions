Round 2. DSA i.e. Coding Round.

- Relevel have only 100 question of their own. Their question are new and unique. Kudos. 

- Each of their question look difficult. They look like you need Ph.D. in CSE and mathematics to solve them. But, they don't. They are designed to fool you.
Think of easy ways to solve, think of O(n) algorithm.
